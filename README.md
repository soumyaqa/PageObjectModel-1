# PageObjectModel

Created this PageObjectModel framework for web application (https://www.stackoverflow.com) using Selenium Webdriver, Java, TestNG, so that people can easily relate to it and understand how to develop an automation framework in clear manner in Page Object Model framework.

You can simply download/clone this repo and you can do some minimal changes as per your application need.

I haven't added too many components automation on it. I made it as simple, so that people can easily kick start the framework development easily.

However couple of things are on the way to add in this repo.

       -> More UI components such as alert view, drop down, radio button, browse button, table, checkboxes etc
       -> TestNG parallelization
       -> Reporting mechanism
       -> Cross browser testing
       -> Gradle tasks
       
Please let me know if you would like me to add any ui component related automation on this framework. Please reach out to me at "srinuk544@gmail.com"
